# Automatic Evaluation Approach Plan

This document outlines the plan for integrating an automatic evaluation approach for the generated user personas and tweet imitations within the current project.

## Evaluation Goals:
1.  **Tweet Imitation Quality**: Assess how well the generated replies and completions (`generated_imitation_text`) match the `original_holdout_tweet_text` in terms of content and style.
2.  **Persona Effectiveness**: Indirectly evaluate personas by analyzing the quality of imitations they produce.

## Proposed Metrics/Methods:
*   **For Tweet Imitation Quality:**
    *   **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**: Measures content overlap between generated and reference texts.
    *   **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**: Measures n-gram precision, indicating how many n-grams in the generated text appear in the reference text.
    *   These metrics are standard for text generation tasks and can be automated.
